Land-use map of catania
=======================

Land use classes map of Catania in GeoJSON format. This data comes from Sicily Region as a shapefile of the entire 
region with CRS Gauss-Boaga "Monte Mario Italy Zone 2" EPSG:3004.

I stripped the unnecessary information about other cities, then reprojected and converted in geojson format the data.

## Embedding GeoJSON elsewhere ##

You could check the [github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github) for using
